# Original Artists' Statement

This is an art project by Zed A. Shaw and Greg Borenstein, who are both artists
so you can't criticize this project because then you'd be showing how much you
hate art.

You don't hate art do you?  Activist art at that?

Well, if it still upsets you I guess you can drown your sorrows on the Playa with the 
knowledge that you are living a truly liberal and aware life while tripping out on
random drugs and having strange things done to your genitals in the hot dusty oppressive
sun of a fucking desert with pretend communists who shell out $16k for a ticket to
a giant 1990s throwback rave full of totally real art made of lights and fire and shit.

You get it burner.  You *matter*.
